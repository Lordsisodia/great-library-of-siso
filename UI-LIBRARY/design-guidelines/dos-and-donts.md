# ✅❌ Design Do's and Don'ts

Clear rules for what works and what doesn't in app design.

## 🎨 Visual Design

### ✅ **DO:**
- Use consistent color palette across the entire app
- Maintain visual hierarchy with size, color, and spacing
- Keep similar elements looking similar
- Use white space generously - it's not wasted space
- Test designs on real devices and screen sizes
- Follow platform conventions (iOS/Android/Web)

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Use too many colors - stick to 3-5 main colors
- Make users guess what's clickable
- Use tiny text that's hard to read
- Cram everything together without spacing
- Copy designs without understanding why they work
- Ignore accessibility requirements

## 📱 Layout & Spacing

### ✅ **DO:**
- Use consistent spacing units (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px)
- Align elements to a grid system
- Group related elements together
- Create clear visual separation between sections
- Design mobile-first, then scale up

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Use random spacing values (13px, 27px, etc.)
- Center everything - alignment matters
- Make layouts too cramped on mobile
- Ignore the fold - important content should be visible
- Use horizontal scrolling (except for carousels)

## 🔘 Buttons & Interactive Elements

### ✅ **DO:**
- Make buttons look obviously clickable
- Use consistent button styles throughout app
- Provide clear hover/focus/active states
- Size touch targets at least 44px for mobile
- Use descriptive button text ("Download Report" not "Click Here")

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Make links look like buttons or vice versa
- Use vague button text ("Submit", "OK", "Continue")
- Make buttons too small for fat fingers
- Forget disabled states for buttons
- Use too many primary buttons on one screen

## 🎭 Colors & Contrast

### ✅ **DO:**
- Ensure sufficient contrast for text (4.5:1 minimum)
- Use color to support meaning, not convey it alone
- Test colors on different screens and lighting
- Have a clear primary, secondary, and accent color
- Consider colorblind users in design decisions

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Use color as the only way to show information
- Use red and green as the only error/success indicators
- Choose colors that vibrate or strain the eyes
- Use pure black on pure white (too harsh)
- Ignore dark mode considerations

## 📝 Typography

### ✅ **DO:**
- Limit to 2-3 font families maximum
- Establish clear text hierarchy (H1, H2, body, etc.)
- Use appropriate line height (1.4-1.6 for body text)
- Make body text at least 16px on mobile
- Left-align body text for better readability

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Use decorative fonts for body text
- Make paragraphs too wide (over 75 characters)
- Use all caps for long text
- Justify text on mobile (creates uneven spacing)
- Use too many font weights and styles

## 📊 Forms & Input

### ✅ **DO:**
- Label every input field clearly
- Show validation errors immediately and clearly
- Use appropriate input types (email, phone, etc.)
- Group related fields together
- Provide helpful placeholder text

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Hide labels inside input fields only
- Use vague error messages ("Invalid input")
- Make required fields unclear
- Ask for information you don't actually need
- Reset form if user makes one error

## 🔄 Navigation & Flow

### ✅ **DO:**
- Make current page/section clearly indicated
- Provide consistent navigation across the app
- Use breadcrumbs for deep navigation
- Show loading states for slow operations
- Allow users to go back easily

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Hide navigation on mobile without good reason
- Use carousel sliders for important content
- Open new tabs/windows unexpectedly
- Make users scroll horizontally to see navigation
- Break the back button functionality

## 📱 Mobile-Specific

### ✅ **DO:**
- Design for thumb-friendly interactions
- Use large, easy-to-tap buttons
- Consider one-handed use patterns
- Test on actual devices, not just desktop browser
- Design for poor network connections

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Put important actions at the top of the screen
- Use hover effects (mobile has no hover)
- Make tap targets smaller than 44px
- Assume users have perfect internet
- Ignore landscape orientation

## ⚡ Performance & Loading

### ✅ **DO:**
- Show loading states for everything that takes time
- Optimize images for different screen densities
- Use skeleton screens instead of spinners when possible
- Load critical content first
- Provide offline functionality when relevant

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Show blank screens while loading
- Use huge unoptimized images
- Make users wait without feedback
- Load everything at once
- Break functionality when offline

## 🎯 User Experience

### ✅ **DO:**
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions
- Make common tasks easy to accomplish
- Test with real users regularly
- Consider edge cases and error states

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Make users think unnecessarily
- Hide important functionality
- Use jargon users won't understand
- Force users into rigid workflows
- Ignore accessibility needs

## 🚀 Quick Decision Framework

**When in doubt, ask:**
1. **Is it clear?** - Can users understand it immediately?
2. **Is it consistent?** - Does it match the rest of the app?
3. **Is it accessible?** - Can everyone use it effectively?
4. **Is it necessary?** - Does it serve the user's goal?
5. **Is it tested?** - Have real users validated it works?

**Remember: Good design is invisible - users accomplish their goals without thinking about the interface.**

This folder contains the essential building blocks and frameworks for app development. Each component represents a critical part of the app building process.

## What Goes Here

- **PRD (Product Requirements Document)** - Templates and examples for defining product requirements
- **Architecture Planning** - System design patterns, database schemas, API designs
- **Testing Frameworks** - Testing strategies, unit test templates, integration testing guides
- **Development Workflows** - CI/CD setups, deployment pipelines, code review processes
- **UI/UX Components** - Reusable interface elements and design patterns
- **Backend Services** - Common service patterns, authentication, data handling
- **Project Management** - Sprint planning, task tracking, milestone templates
- **Quality Assurance** - Code quality standards, review checklists, best practices

## Structure

Add folders for each component type as needed. Keep it simple and organized.

Examples:
- `prd-templates/`
- `architecture-patterns/`
- `testing-frameworks/`
- `deployment-configs/`
- `ui-components/`

Each component should include clear documentation and practical examples.

## The Strategic PRD Process

### Core Philosophy
**Quote from Video**: "The first file is of course a well-known PRD... So what's really cool about having a PRD and all of the task templates directly inside your repo is that you have full control over them"

**Strategic Advantage**: When PRD templates live in your repo, you maintain full control over how AI agents scope and implement features, unlike external tools where you can't control the prompting templates.

## 3-Stage PRD Development Process

### Stage 1: Product Understanding (Context Building)
```
1. Read product-development/resources/product.md - Understand the overall product
2. Read product-development/current-feature/feature.md - Understand the specific feature
3. Read product-development/current-feature/JTBD.md - Understand Jobs to be Done
```

**Purpose**: Build comprehensive context before any requirements definition begins

### Stage 2: Requirements Extraction (AI-Assisted Questioning)
**Quote from Video**: "For scoping I actually do prefer GPT5 high... for scoping I do find that GPT5 is really good"

**Process**:
1. **Initial Questions**: AI generates first round of clarifying questions
2. **Follow-up Deep Dive**: "Do you have any other questions before you can scope a PRD"
3. **Targeted Refinement**: Second round focuses on specific implementation details

**Example from Video**:
- First round: Basic product questions
- Second round: "Whether the greeting is always at the start of the video which is honestly like a very important question"

### Stage 3: PRD Document Generation
Using structured template to capture:
- What (features and functionality)
- Why (user needs and business value) 
- How (user experience and success metrics)

## Enhanced PRD Template Structure

### üéØ **Product Vision & Strategy**
```markdown
## Product Vision
**Mission**: [Core problem being solved]
**Vision Statement**: [1-2 year outlook]
**Success Definition**: [What success looks like]

## Core Value Propositions
1. **[Value Prop 1]**: [Unique differentiator]
2. **[Value Prop 2]**: [Competitive advantage]
3. **[Value Prop 3]**: [User pain point solved]
```

### üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture Planning**
```markdown
## Architecture Decision Records Integration
- Reference ADR.md for architectural decisions
- Document technology stack rationale
- Define integration patterns and constraints

## Tech Stack Justification
- **Frontend**: [Framework + why chosen]
- **Backend**: [Database/API + business rationale] 
- **Special Features**: [AI/third-party integrations + value]
```

### üéÆ **Feature Specification with Database Requirements**

#### **Feature-to-Database Mapping**
For each feature, specify:
```markdown
### [Feature Name]
**User Story**: As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]

**Database Requirements**:
- **Read Operations**: [Specific queries needed]
- **Write Operations**: [Data creation/updates]
- **API Endpoints**: [RESTful endpoints required]

**Example**:
GET /api/tasks/:userId?filter=priority&sort=date
POST /api/tasks/:userId
PUT /api/tasks/:taskId/complete
```

### üìä **User Personas with Technical Context**
```markdown
## Primary Personas
### [User Type] - Technical Profile
- **Needs**: [Functional requirements]
- **Usage Patterns**: [API usage patterns, data volume]
- **Technical Constraints**: [Device/platform limitations]
- **Data Requirements**: [What data they create/consume]
```

### üöÄ **Development Roadmap with AI Workflow Integration**

#### **Phase-Based Development**
```markdown
### Phase 1: Foundation [Status: üîÑ]
**AI Workflow Steps**:
1. **Architecture**: Define types and structure
2. **Types**: Create request/response/database types  
3. **Tests**: Write integration tests with real data
4. **Build**: Implement core features
5. **Document**: Update ADR with decisions

**Features**:
- [Core feature 1] - [Database operations required]
- [Core feature 2] - [API integrations needed]
```

## PRD Integration with 5-Step AI Workflow

### Step 1: Architecture Planning
**PRD Input**: Technical architecture section provides foundation
**Output**: ADR.md with architectural decisions
**Connection**: PRD technical requirements ‚Üí Architecture planning

### Step 2: Types Definition  
**PRD Input**: Feature specifications with database requirements
**Output**: TypeScript interfaces for requests/responses/database
**Connection**: PRD data requirements ‚Üí Type definitions

### Step 3: Test Generation
**PRD Input**: User stories and success metrics
**Output**: Integration tests with real data scenarios
**Connection**: PRD user scenarios ‚Üí Test cases

### Step 4: Feature Implementation
**PRD Input**: Feature specifications and API requirements
**Output**: Working code with defined interfaces
**Connection**: PRD functionality ‚Üí Implementation

### Step 5: Documentation
**PRD Input**: Architectural decisions and rationale
**Output**: Updated ADR with implementation learnings  
**Connection**: PRD decisions ‚Üí Documentation updates

## GPT-5 Optimized PRD Scoping Process

### Initial Scoping Prompt
```
You are an experienced Product Manager creating a PRD.

CONTEXT FILES:
- product.md: Overall product understanding
- feature.md: Specific feature to develop  
- JTBD.md: Jobs to be Done analysis

TASK: Generate clarifying questions to create comprehensive PRD

FOCUS AREAS:
- User workflows and edge cases
- Technical implementation requirements
- Success metrics and analytics needs
- Integration points with existing systems
```

### Follow-up Refinement
```
Based on initial answers, ask targeted technical questions:
- API integration requirements
- Database schema needs
- Real-time update requirements  
- Security and permission models
- Scalability considerations
```

## Page-by-Page Requirements Analysis

### Methodology from SISO-INTERNAL
**Systematic Approach**:
1. **Current State Analysis**: Document existing localStorage/mock usage
2. **Database Operations Mapping**: Define specific CRUD operations needed
3. **API Endpoint Definition**: List all required REST endpoints
4. **Integration Priority**: Phase implementation by user impact

**Example Analysis Pattern**:
```markdown
### [Page Name]
**Current**: [Current data source]
**Database Requirements**:

#### Read Operations:
- Model.findMany() - [Purpose and filters]
- Model.findUnique() - [Specific lookups]

#### Write Operations:  
- Model.create() - [New data creation]
- Model.update() - [Data modifications]

#### API Endpoints:
GET /api/[resource]/:userId?filter=...
POST /api/[resource]/:userId  
PUT /api/[resource]/:id
```

## AI Tool Integration Patterns

### For Any AI Coding Tool
**Universal PRD Reference Pattern**:
```
IMPLEMENT [feature from PRD]

REFERENCE FILES:
- PRD.md: Product requirements and user stories
- ADR.md: Architectural decisions and patterns
- types/: Shared interface definitions

REQUIREMENTS:
- Follow PRD user stories exactly
- Use database operations from PRD specification
- Implement API endpoints as defined in PRD
- Test with real data scenarios from PRD
```

### Model-Specific Usage
- **GPT-5**: PRD scoping and planning (best at analysis)
- **Sonnet**: Implementation following PRD specs
- **Opus**: Complex feature implementation from PRD

## Quality Assurance Integration

### PRD Validation Checklist
- [ ] All user stories have corresponding database operations
- [ ] API endpoints defined for each data requirement
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable and specific
- [ ] Technical architecture aligns with feature requirements
- [ ] Integration points with existing systems documented

### AI Workflow Validation
- [ ] PRD provides sufficient context for architecture planning
- [ ] Feature specs translate clearly to type definitions  
- [ ] User stories provide clear test scenarios
- [ ] Implementation requirements are unambiguous
- [ ] Documentation needs are specified

## Template Customization Strategy

### Project-Specific Adaptations
```markdown
## [Your Stack] Specific Patterns
- **Database**: [Your DB + query patterns]
- **API Style**: [REST/GraphQL + conventions]
- **Auth Pattern**: [Your auth system integration]
- **Real-time**: [WebSocket/Server-sent events approach]
```

### Client Project Integration
```markdown
## Client-Specific Requirements
- **Branding**: [Client brand integration points]
- **Compliance**: [Industry-specific requirements]
- **Integration**: [Client system integration needs]
- **Deployment**: [Client infrastructure constraints]
```

This comprehensive PRD framework bridges product strategy with technical implementation, providing AI agents with the complete context needed for reliable feature development from conception to deployment.

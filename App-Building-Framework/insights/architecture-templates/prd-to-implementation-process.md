# PRD to Implementation Process Template

**Source**: [AI Coding Workflow YouTube Video](../videos/youtube/ai-coding-workflow-production-template.md)

## The Complete Flow

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
**Tool**: GPT-5 (best for analysis and planning)
**Process**: Interactive questioning until complete context

### Phase 2: Task Breakdown  
**Tool**: GPT-5 with task templates
**Output**: Specific, actionable tasks with dependencies

### Phase 3: Parallel Implementation
**Tools**: Multiple agents (Cursor Sonnet, Claude Code)
**Strategy**: Work on non-dependent tasks simultaneously

## PRD Creation Process

### Step 1: Initial Requirements Capture
```
Prompt: "Ask me questions until you have enough context to fill out this PRD template"
```

**First Round Questions** (GPT-5 asks):
- What's the product name?
- Who are the primary users?  
- What's the main job to be done?
- What are the key features?
- What's the expected user flow?

### Step 2: Deep Dive Questioning
```
Follow-up: "Do you have any other questions before you can scope a PRD?"
```

**Second Round Questions** (Much more targeted):
- Is the greeting always at the start of the video?
- What file formats are supported?
- How do users handle errors or failed processing?
- What's the expected processing time?
- How is user data stored and secured?

**Key Insight**: "The second round of questions is actually much better than the first one. This one is a lot more targeted towards what I want to build."

### Step 3: PRD Document Generation
**GPT-5 generates complete PRD based on Q&A session**

**PRD Template Structure**:
```markdown
# Product Requirements Document

## Overview
- Product name and vision
- Target users and use cases
- Core value proposition

## Functional Requirements  
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Feature specifications
- User flow diagrams

## Technical Requirements
- Architecture constraints
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Integration requirements

## Success Metrics
- KPIs and measurement criteria
- Launch criteria
- Success definition
```

## Task Breakdown Process

### Input: Completed PRD + Task Template
```
Prompt: "Break down this PRD into separate tasks using this task template"
```

### Output: Structured Task List

**Example Task Structure**:
```markdown
## Task: API 11Labs Integration
**Dependencies**: None
**Files to modify**: 
- src/services/11labs.js
- src/types/audio.ts
**Description**: Create wrapper for 11Labs API
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Voice synthesis working with test data
- Error handling for API failures  
- Integration tests with real API
```

### Key Task Properties:
- **Dependencies**: Which tasks must complete first
- **File references**: Specific files to create/modify
- **Architecture alignment**: Matches chosen patterns (event-driven, etc.)
- **Testing requirements**: Integration tests with real data

## Implementation Coordination

### Multi-Agent Strategy
**Based on dependency analysis from GPT-5**:

```
Agent 1: 11Labs API Wrapper (no dependencies)
Agent 2: FFmpeg Video Service (no dependencies)  
Agent 3: Firestore Rules (no dependencies)
Agent 4: Frontend Auth (no dependencies)

Agent 5: Background Processing (depends on Agent 1,2)
Agent 6: Upload UI (depends on Agent 3,4)
```

### Tracking Progress
**Use git changes panel to monitor**:
- What files each agent is modifying
- Progress on individual tasks
- Conflicts between agents

**Example from video**: "In less than 10 minutes they have already modified over 40 different files"

## Quality Control Process

### Review Strategy: "Review Only the Tests"
**Why**: "Tests are crucial for AI because they provide the guardrails"

**What to check**:
- Are tests using real data (not mocks)?
- Do tests cover the actual requirements?
- Are integration tests calling real APIs?

**Red flags**:
- Tests using fake/mock data
- Tests that don't actually run
- Missing tests for critical functionality

### Context Preservation
**ADR Documentation**: After each major task completion

```markdown
## ADR Update Required
**What**: Document key architectural decisions made during implementation
**Why**: Future agents need context of what worked/didn't work
**When**: After completing complex tasks or solving difficult problems
```

## Real-World Example (DM Outreach System)

### PRD → Tasks Breakdown Result:
**15 minutes with GPT-5 produced**:
- 10+ specific tasks with dependencies
- Event-driven architecture properly referenced
- Real file paths from template structure
- Firestore security rules included
- Integration test specifications

**Quote**: "GPT-5 is just insane at planning. It actually planned everything extremely well. I don't even think that I would be able to do a better job myself in just 15 minutes."

### Implementation Results:
**Multiple agents working in parallel**:
- 4+ agents running simultaneously
- 40+ files modified in 10 minutes
- Real integration tests with APIs
- Working product in under 1 hour

**Traditional comparison**: "Before for a real developer, this would have taken like a week to do by himself."

## Template Integration Points

### With 5-Step Workflow:
1. **Architecture Planning**: PRD creation with GPT-5
2. **Types**: Defined during task breakdown
3. **Tests**: Specified in each task  
4. **Implementation**: Multi-agent coordination
5. **Documentation**: ADR updates after completion

### With Firebase Architecture:
- Tasks reference Firebase-specific patterns
- Security rules scoped during planning
- Event-driven flows properly mapped
- Real-time update patterns included

## Success Metrics

### Planning Quality Indicators:
✅ Second round of questions significantly more specific
✅ Tasks have clear dependencies mapped
✅ Architecture patterns consistently referenced
✅ Real file paths and integration points specified

### Implementation Quality Indicators:  
✅ Multiple agents working without conflicts
✅ Integration tests using real APIs/data
✅ Git changes show coordinated progress
✅ Working product deliverable quickly

### Knowledge Preservation:
✅ ADR documents updated with key decisions
✅ Context preserved for future agent sessions
✅ Architectural decisions clearly documented
✅ Issue solutions recorded for reuse

This process template transforms high-level product ideas into working implementations through systematic planning, intelligent task breakdown, and coordinated multi-agent development.

  "cerebras_response": "Optimizing token usage across multiple AI models involves several strategies to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. Here are some steps to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Token Pooling**: Create a central token pool that can be accessed by multiple AI models. This way, you can allocate tokens in bulk, reducing overhead costs and making it easier to manage your token budget.\n2. **Token Caching**: Implement a caching mechanism to store frequently used tokens. This can help reduce the number of requests to the AI models, saving tokens and improving performance.\n3. **Token Queuing**: Use a queuing system to manage token requests from multiple AI models. This can help prioritize requests, reduce latency, and optimize token usage.\n4. **Model Selection**: Choose AI models that offer token pricing plans that fit your budget. Consider factors like token cost, model accuracy, and latency when selecting models.\n5. **Token Budgeting**: Set a token budget for each AI model and monitor token usage to ensure you stay within budget. This can help prevent unexpected token costs and optimize resource allocation.\n6. **Token Recycling**: Implement a token recycling mechanism to reuse tokens that have been used by one AI model but are still valid for another model.\n7. **Token Compression**: Compress tokens to reduce their size and improve transmission efficiency. This can help minimize token usage and reduce costs.\n8. **Token Prioritization**: Prioritize token requests based on importance, urgency, or business value. This can help ensure that critical tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.\n9. **Model Optimization**: Optimize AI models to reduce token usage. This can be achieved through techniques like model pruning, knowledge distillation, or quantization.\n10. **Monitoring and Analysis**: Continuously monitor token usage and analyze usage patterns to identify areas for improvement. This can help optimize token usage and reduce costs over time.\n\n**Tools and Techniques**:\n\n1. **Token Brokers**: Use token brokers like Hugging Face's Tokenizer or Google Cloud's Tokenizer to manage token usage and optimize token allocation.\n2. **API Gateways**: Implement API gateways like AWS API Gateway or Google Cloud Endpoints to manage token requests and optimize token usage.\n3. **Token Management Platforms**: Use platforms like Token Management Platform (TMP) or Token Management System (TMS) to manage token usage and optimize token allocation.\n4. **Machine Learning Model Optimization Techniques**: Use techniques like model pruning, knowledge distillation, or quantization to optimize",

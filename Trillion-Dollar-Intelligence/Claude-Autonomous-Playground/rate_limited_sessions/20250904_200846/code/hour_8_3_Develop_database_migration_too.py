# AI-Generated Implementation:
**Database Migration Tools**

This Python package provides a set of tools to manage database migrations. It includes classes for defining migrations, executing migrations, and managing the migration history.

**Installation**

To use this package, you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install database_migration_tools
```
**Usage**

To use the migration tools, you need to create a configuration file (`config.py`) that contains the database connection details and other settings.

```python
# config.py
import os

class Config:
    DB_HOST = 'localhost'
    DB_NAME = 'mydatabase'
    DB_USER = 'myuser'
    DB_PASSWORD = 'mypassword'
    MIGRATION_TABLE = 'migrations'
```

Then, you can create a `Migration` class that defines the migration operations:
```python
# migration.py
import os
from database_migration_tools import Migration

class MyMigration(Migration):
    def up(self):
        # Create a new table
        self.execute('''
            CREATE TABLE mytable (
                id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                name VARCHAR(255)
            )
        ''')

    def down(self):
        # Drop the table
        self.execute('DROP TABLE mytable')
```

Finally, you can create a `MigrationManager` instance that takes care of executing the migrations:
```python
# migration_manager.py
import os
from database_migration_tools import MigrationManager

class MyMigrationManager(MigrationManager):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.migrations = [MyMigration]

    def migrate(self):
        self.execute_migrations()
```

**Implementation**

Here's the complete implementation of the migration tools:
```python
# database_migration_tools.py
import os
import logging
from typing import List, Dict

class Migration:
    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str = ''):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description

    def up(self) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError

    def down(self) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError

    def execute(self, query: str, params: Dict = None):
        # Execute the query using the database connection
        # This method should be implemented by the user
        raise NotImplementedError

class MigrationManager:
    def __init__(self, config: Dict):
        self.config = config
        self.migrations = []

    def add_migration(self, migration: Migration):
        self.migrations.append(migration)

    def execute_migrations(self):
        # Execute the migrations in the correct order
        for migration in self.migrations:
            try:
                self.execute_migration(migration)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f'Error executing migration {migration.name}: {e}')

    def execute_migration(self, migration: Migration):
        # Check if the migration has already been executed
        if self.has_migration_executed(migration):
            return

        # Execute the migration
        self.execute_migration_up(migration)

        # Update the migration history
        self.update_migration_history(migration)

    def execute_migration_up(self, migration: Migration):
        # Execute the migration's 'up' method
        query = migration.up()
        self.execute(query)

    def update_migration_history(self, migration: Migration):
        # Update the database with the new migration
        query = f'INSERT INTO {self.config["MIGRATION_TABLE"]} (name, description) VALUES (%s, %s)'
        self.execute(query, params=(migration.name, migration.description))

    def has_migration_executed(self, migration: Migration) -> bool:
        # Check if the migration has already been executed
        query = f'SELECT 1 FROM {self.config["MIGRATION_TABLE"]} WHERE name = %s'
        result = self.execute(query, params=(migration.name,))
        return result and len(result) > 0

    def execute(self, query: str, params: Dict = None):
        # Execute the query using the database connection
        # This method should be implemented by the user
        raise NotImplementedError
```

**Example Usage**

Here's an example of how to use the migration tools:
```python
# main.py
import os
from database_migration_tools import MigrationManager
from migration import MyMigration

def main():
    # Create a configuration file
    config = {
        'DB_HOST': 'localhost',
        'DB_NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'DB_USER': 'myuser',
        'DB_PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'MIGRATION_TABLE': 'migrations'
    }

    # Create a migration manager instance
    migration_manager = MigrationManager(config)

    # Add a migration
    migration_manager.add_migration(MyMigration())

    # Execute the migrations
    migration_manager.migrate()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Error Handling**

The migration tools provide basic error handling using try-except blocks. If an error occurs during the execution of a migration, it is logged and the migration is skipped.

**Logging**

The migration tools use the Python built-in `logging` module to log events. You can configure the logging level and format to suit your needs.

**Configuration Management**

The migration tools allow you to manage the configuration using a configuration file (`config.py`). You can add or modify configuration settings as needed.

**API Documentation**

Here's a brief API documentation for the migration tools:
```markdown
### Migration

* `__init__`: Initializes a new migration instance.
* `up`: Executes the migration's 'up' method.
* `down`: Executes the migration's 'down' method.

### MigrationManager

* `__init__`: Initializes a new migration manager instance.
* `add_migration`: Adds a migration to the manager.
* `execute_migrations`: Executes all migrations in the correct order.
* `execute_migration`: Executes a single migration.
* `has_migration_executed`: Checks if a migration has already been executed.
```
Note that this is a simplified example of a database migration tool. In a real-world scenario, you would need to add more features, such as support for multiple databases, transactional behavior, and more.

## Problem Statement
Technical analysis of Time series forecasting methods - Hour 10

## Detailed Analysis and Solution
## Technical Analysis and Solution for Time Series Forecasting - Hour 10

This analysis focuses on forecasting time series data at the granularity of "Hour 10" (specifically, the value at the 10th hour of each day/period). This specific granularity has implications for feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.

**1. Problem Definition and Understanding:**

* **Goal:**  Accurately forecast the value of a time series at the 10th hour of each day/period (e.g., demand, temperature, website traffic).
* **Data Characteristics:**
    * **Frequency:**  Hourly.  We are only interested in the value at hour 10.
    * **Seasonality:** Potential daily (24-hour), weekly (168-hour), monthly, and yearly patterns.  The 10th hour might exhibit specific seasonal behavior.
    * **Trend:** Upward, downward, or stable trend over time.
    * **Autocorrelation:**  Relationship between the value at hour 10 on different days/periods.
    * **External Factors:**  Holidays, promotions, weather events, economic indicators, etc., that might influence the value at hour 10.
    * **Missing Values:**  Gaps in the data can significantly impact forecasting accuracy.
    * **Outliers:** Extreme values that deviate significantly from the norm.
* **Evaluation Metric:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), or a custom metric tailored to the specific business problem.  Crucially, the chosen metric *only* considers the error at hour 10.

**2. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:**

This stage is critical. Since we're only forecasting for hour 10, we need to extract and engineer features relevant to that specific hour.

* **Data Extraction:**  Filter the hourly data to only include the values at the 10th hour of each day/period.
* **Time-Based Features:**
    * **Lag Features (Autoregressive Features):**  Values from previous days/periods at hour 10 (e.g., value at hour 10 yesterday, last week, last month). The number of lags depends on the autocorrelation structure of the data.  Use Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to determine appropriate lag orders.
    * **Rolling Statistics:**  Moving average, moving standard deviation, and other rolling statistics calculated *only* on the hour 10 data. This helps smooth out noise and capture trends.
    * **Date/Time Features:**
        * **Day of Week:**  Is hour 10 on a weekday or weekend?
        * **Day of Year:** Captures annual seasonality.
        * **Month of Year:**  Captures monthly seasonality.
        * **Quarter of Year:**  Captures quarterly seasonality.
        * **Holiday Indicator:**  A binary variable indicating whether the day is a holiday.
* **External Features:**
    * **Weather Data:** Temperature, precipitation, humidity at hour 10.
    * **Economic Indicators:**  Relevant economic data that might influence the time series.
    * **Promotion Indicators:**  Binary variables indicating whether a promotion is running.
* **Feature Scaling:**  Scale numerical features using techniques like StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler, especially when using models sensitive to feature scaling (e.g., neural networks, k-NN).
* **Handling Missing Values:**
    * **Imputation:**  Replace missing values with the mean, median, or a more sophisticated imputation method (e.g., k-NN imputation).  Consider using a time series specific imputation method like seasonal decomposition.
    * **Deletion:**  If the number of missing values is small, you might consider deleting the rows with missing values.
* **Outlier Detection and Treatment:**  Identify and remove or transform outliers using techniques like Z-score, IQR, or domain expertise.

**3. Model Selection and Architecture Recommendations:**

The choice of model depends on the characteristics of the data and the desired level of accuracy. Here are some suitable options:

* **Statistical Models:**
    * **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):**  Suitable if the data exhibits stationarity or can be made stationary through differencing.  Determine the optimal (p, d, q) parameters using ACF/PACF plots or automated methods like auto_arima.  Specifically, you are fitting ARIMA to the time series of values at hour 10.
    * **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):**  Suitable if the data exhibits seasonality. Determine the optimal (p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s) parameters, where 's' is the seasonal period (e.g., 24 for daily seasonality, 168 for weekly seasonality).  Again, this is applied *only* to the hour 10 data.
    * **Exponential Smoothing (ETS):** Suitable for data with trend and seasonality.  Holt-Winters' method is a popular choice.
* **Machine Learning Models:**
    * **Linear Regression:** A simple baseline model.  Can be surprisingly effective with well-engineered features.
    * **Random Forest:**  A powerful ensemble method that can capture non-linear relationships.
    * **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):** XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost are popular choices for time series forecasting.  They can handle complex relationships and missing values.
    * **Support Vector Regression (SVR):**  Can be effective for non-linear time series data.
* **Deep Learning Models:**
    * **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**  LSTMs and GRUs are well-suited for time series data because they can capture temporal dependencies.
    * **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs):**  Can be more efficient than RNNs for long time series.
    * **Transformers:**  Becoming increasingly popular for time series forecasting. They can capture long-range dependencies.

**Architecture Recommendations:**

* **For ARIMA/SARIMA:**  Focus on identifying the correct order parameters.  Use automated methods like `auto_arima` or grid search to find the best parameters.
* **For Machine Learning Models (e.g., Random Forest, GBM):**
    * **Feature Importance Analysis:**  Use feature importance scores to identify the most relevant features and potentially remove irrelevant ones.
    * **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Use techniques like grid search or random search to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
* **For Deep Learning Models (e.g., LSTM):**
    * **Input Shape:** The input shape should be (number of samples, time steps, number of features).  The time steps represent the number of historical data points used to predict the value at hour 10. The number of features is the number of input features (lag features, date/time features, external features).
    * **Network Architecture:** Experiment with different numbers of LSTM layers, hidden units, and dropout rates.

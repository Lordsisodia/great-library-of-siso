## Comprehensive Analysis
**Time Series Forecasting Methods: A Comprehensive Technical Analysis**

Time series forecasting is a crucial aspect of many fields, including finance, economics, marketing, and supply chain management. It involves predicting future values based on historical data, which can help organizations make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and optimize performance. In this technical analysis, we will cover various time series forecasting methods, including:

1. **Autoregressive (AR) Model**
2. **Moving Average (MA) Model**
3. **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model**
4. **Seasonal Decomposition**
5. **Exponential Smoothing (ES)**
6. **Holt-Winters Method**
7. **Prophet**
8. **LSTM Networks**
9. **GRU Networks**
10. **ARIMA with External Regressors**

**1. Autoregressive (AR) Model**

The AR model assumes that the current value of a time series is a function of past values. The general equation for an AR model is:

y(t) = β0 + β1y(t-1) + β2y(t-2) + ... + βpy(t-p) + ε(t)

where y(t) is the value at time t, β0 is the constant term, β1, β2, ..., βp are the autoregressive coefficients, and ε(t) is the error term.

**Code Example (Python):**
```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.ar_model import AutoReg

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=['date'])

# Create AR model
model = AutoReg(data['value'], lags=5)

# Fit model
model_fit = model.fit()

# Print coefficients
print(model_fit.params)
```

**2. Moving Average (MA) Model**

The MA model assumes that the current value of a time series is a function of past errors. The general equation for an MA model is:

y(t) = μ + ε(t) + θ1ε(t-1) + θ2ε(t-2) + ... + θqε(t-q)

where y(t) is the value at time t, μ is the mean of the errors, θ1, θ2, ..., θq are the moving average coefficients, and ε(t) is the error term.

**Code Example (Python):**
```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.ma_model import MovingAverage

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=['date'])

# Create MA model
model = MovingAverage(data['value'], lags=5)

# Fit model
model_fit = model.fit()

# Print coefficients
print(model_fit.params)
```

**3. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model**

The ARIMA model combines the autoregressive and moving average components with differencing to handle non-stationarity. The general equation for an ARIMA model is:

y(t) = β0 + β1y(t-1) + β2y(t-2) + ... + βpy(t-p) + ε(t) + θ1ε(t-1) + θ2ε(t-2) + ... + θqε(t-q)

where y(t) is the value at time t, β0 is the constant term, β1, β2, ..., βp are the autoregressive coefficients, θ1, θ2, ..., θq are the moving average coefficients, and ε(t) is the error term.

**Code Example (Python):**
```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=['date'])

# Create ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data['value'], order=(2,1,2))

# Fit model
model_fit = model.fit()

# Print coefficients
print(model_fit.params)
```

**4. Seasonal Decomposition**

Seasonal decomposition involves separating a time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components. The general equation for seasonal decomposition is:

y(t) = T(t) + S(t) + R(t)

where y(t) is the original time series, T(t) is the trend component, S(t) is the seasonal component, and R(t) is the residual component.

**Code Example (Python):**
```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=['date'])

# Create seasonal decomposition model
decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(data['value'], model='additive')

# Plot components
decomposition.plot()
```

**5. Exponential Smoothing (ES)**

Exponential smoothing involves using a weighted average of past values to make predictions. The general equation for exponential smoothing is:

y(t) = αy(t-1) + (1-α)y(t-2) + ... + (1-α)^{p-1}y(t-p)

where y(t) is the predicted value, α is the smoothing parameter, and y(t-1), y(t-2), ..., y(t-p) are past values.

**Code Example (Python):**
```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import SimpleExpSmoothing

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=['date'])

# Create exponential smoothing model
model = SimpleExpSmoothing(data['value'])

# Fit model
model_fit = model.fit()

# Print coefficients
print(model_fit.params)
```

**6. Holt-Winters Method**

The Holt-Winters method is an extension of exponential smoothing that accounts for trend and seasonal components. The general equation for the Holt-Winters method is:

y(t) = αy(t-1) + (1-α)(y(t-1) + β(t-1))

where y(t) is the predicted value, α is the smoothing parameter, and β(t-1) is the trend component.

**Code Example (Python):**
```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import ExponentialSmoothing

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=['date'])

# Create Holt-Winters model
model = ExponentialSmoothing(data['value'], trend='add', seasonal='add')

# Fit model
model_fit = model.fit()

# Print coefficients
print(model_fit.params)
```

**7. Prophet**

Prophet is a popular open-source software for forecasting time series data. It uses a generalized additive model with a seasonal component to make predictions.

**Code Example (Python):**
```python
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=['date'])

# Create Prophet model
model = Prophet()

# Fit model
model.fit(data)

# Make predictions
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)
forecast = model.predict(f

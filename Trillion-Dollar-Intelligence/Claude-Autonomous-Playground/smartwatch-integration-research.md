- **Cerebras (Efficiency)**: Coding help, optimization advice
- **Gemini (Reasoning)**: Complex analysis, creative tasks, problem-solving
- **Local Models**: Private/sensitive information processing

### Phase 4: Continuous Memory System
**Memory Architecture:**
```yaml
working_memory:
  context_window: "Last 10 interactions"
  current_session: "Real-time conversation state"

episodic_memory: 
  daily_summaries: "Key insights and decisions"
  project_context: "Ongoing work and goals"
  
semantic_memory:
  user_preferences: "Communication style, priorities"
  domain_knowledge: "Accumulated expertise areas"

```

## üì± USER EXPERIENCE FLOWS

### Morning Briefing
```
User: "Good morning, what's on my agenda?"
AI: "Good morning! You have 3 meetings today. The 2PM client call needs the revised proposal - I'll remind you at 1:30PM to review it."
```

### Continuous Coding Assistance
```
User: "I'm stuck on this algorithm optimization"
AI: "Based on your code patterns, try implementing a hash map for O(1) lookups instead of the nested loops. Want me to route this to Cerebras for detailed optimization analysis?"
```

### Real-Time Meeting Analysis
```
User: (During meeting) "Save this insight about compound intelligence"
AI: "Noted: 'Compound intelligence insight from client meeting.' I'll add this to your AI strategy notes and remind you to explore implementation options."
```

### Ambient Problem Solving
```
User: "I need to make a decision about the project timeline"
AI: "I'll analyze the factors. Give me 30 seconds to process with Gemini Pro for strategic reasoning."
Response: "Based on your previous decisions and current project constraints, I recommend..."
```

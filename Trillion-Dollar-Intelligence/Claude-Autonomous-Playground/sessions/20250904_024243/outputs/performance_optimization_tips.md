# Performance Optimization Tips
*Auto-generated by Local Autonomous System on 2025-09-04*

## Profiling Tools
- **cProfile** - Built-in Python profiler
- **line_profiler** - Line-by-line profiling
- **memory_profiler** - Memory usage profiling
- **py-spy** - Sampling profiler

## Common Optimizations
1. **Algorithm Optimization** - Choose efficient algorithms
2. **Data Structure Selection** - Use appropriate data structures
3. **Caching** - Cache expensive computations
4. **Database Optimization** - Optimize queries and indexing
5. **Async Programming** - Use async/await for I/O operations

## Memory Management
```python
# Use generators for large datasets
def process_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        for line in f:  # Generator, doesn't load entire file
            yield process_line(line)

# Use __slots__ for classes with many instances
class Point:
    __slots__ = ['x', 'y']
    
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```

## Database Optimization
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper indexing
- Avoid N+1 query problems
- Use bulk operations when possible
- Monitor query performance

## Monitoring
- Set up application metrics
- Monitor resource usage
- Track response times
- Alert on performance degradation

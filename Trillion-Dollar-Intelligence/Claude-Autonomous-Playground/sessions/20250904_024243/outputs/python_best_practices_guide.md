# Python Best Practices Guide
*Auto-generated by Local Autonomous System on 2025-09-04*

## Code Organization
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (< 20 lines ideally)
- Use type hints for better code clarity
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

## Error Handling
```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
    return result
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Specific error occurred: {e}")
    return default_value
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    raise
```

## Performance Tips
- Use list comprehensions for simple operations
- Consider generators for large datasets
- Profile your code to identify bottlenecks
- Use appropriate data structures (sets for membership tests)

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all functions
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Dependencies
- Pin versions in requirements.txt
- Use virtual environments
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Regular security updates

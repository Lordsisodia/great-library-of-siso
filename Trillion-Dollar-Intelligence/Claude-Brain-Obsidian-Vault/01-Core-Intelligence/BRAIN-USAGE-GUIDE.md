- **memory**: External memory and knowledge base

**Result**: 5-10x cognitive bandwidth through externalization

### **Technique 2: Cognitive Load Balancing**
```bash
# Distribute cognitive load across system components
# High cognitive load â†’ ultra-think window
# Medium cognitive load â†’ agents windows  
# Low cognitive load â†’ automated processes
# Meta-cognitive load â†’ control-center
```

**Result**: Prevents cognitive overload and maintains peak performance

### **Technique 3: Pattern-Based Acceleration**
```bash
# Leverage learning engine for cognitive shortcuts
tmux select-window -t learning-dashboard

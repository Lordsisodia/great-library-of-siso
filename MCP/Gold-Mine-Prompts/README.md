3. Plan context handoffs between phases
4. Set up checkpoints for progress tracking"
```

### **Research Acceleration**
```
"I need to research [TOPIC] efficiently using MCP tools.
Please create a research plan that:
1. Uses community insights MCPs (Reddit, etc.)
2. Leverages documentation and code MCPs
3. Includes expert analysis from multiple models
4. Organizes findings for easy reference"
```

## üîç **Debugging & Troubleshooting Prompts**

### **MCP Connection Issues**
```
"I'm having trouble with [MCP_NAME] setup. The issue is: [DESCRIPTION].
Can you help troubleshoot by:
1. Checking common setup issues for this MCP
2. Validating my configuration
3. Testing the connection step-by-step
4. Providing alternative setup approaches"
```

### **Performance Optimization**
```
"My MCP workflow is slower than expected. Current setup: [DESCRIPTION].
Please analyze:
1. Potential bottlenecks in my MCP chain
2. Token usage optimization opportunities  
3. Model selection efficiency
4. Workflow restructuring suggestions"
```

## üí° **Creative & Experimental Prompts**

### **MCP Playground Exploration**
```
"I want to experiment with [MCP_NAME] capabilities I haven't used yet.

## üéØ **Optimal SISO Workflows**

### **As Primary Coordinator**
```bash
# Claude Code manages overall project
claude-code --project=siso-wrapper --role=coordinator

Responsibilities:
- Define overall architecture and component boundaries
- Create shared types and interface contracts
- Coordinate with other specialized agents
- Handle final integration and quality assurance
```

### **As Specialized Agent**
```bash
# Claude Code as architecture specialist
claude-code --workspace=agent-core --role=architect

Focus Areas:
- Multi-agent system design
- Context management architecture  
- Event-driven coordination patterns
- Performance and scalability planning
```

## üîÑ **Integration with Other Tools**

### **Complementary Tools**
- **+ Cursor**: Claude Code (planning) + Cursor (implementation)
- **+ Conductor UI**: Visual management of Claude Code instances
- **+ Git Worktrees**: Isolated environments for parallel development
- **+ TypeScript**: Enhanced type safety and AI guardrails

### **Workflow Optimization**
```yaml
Phase 1 - Planning:
  Tool: Claude Code
  Focus: Architecture, types, test planning
  Output: ADR documents, interface contracts

Phase 2 - Implementation:  
  Tool: Claude Code + Cursor (parallel)
  Focus: Specialized development in isolated workspaces
  Output: Component implementation

Phase 3 - Integration:
  Tool: Claude Code (coordinator)
  Focus: Merge management, quality assurance
  Output: Production-ready system
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations & Considerations**

### **Potential Challenges**
- **Resource Usage**: Can be intensive with multiple instances
- **Rate Limits**: API limitations with heavy usage
- **Context Overload**: May lose focus with too much information
- **Single-threaded**: Works best with clear, focused tasks

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Agent Specialization**: Clear role boundaries prevent context overload
- **Rate Management**: Staggered agent startup and monitoring
- **Context Engineering**: Focused prompts maintain clarity
- **Quality Gates**: Regular validation prevents drift

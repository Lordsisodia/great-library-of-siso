# 🚀 SISO Agent Wrapper - Proof of Concept Implementation

## 🎯 **Mission**
Validate the SANDBOX method with 3-4 parallel agents to achieve 76% development time reduction using battle-tested workflows.

---

## 📋 **POC Validation Plan**

### **Phase 1A: Tool Selection & Setup (Week 1)**
- [ ] Choose SANDBOX tool (Conductor UI vs Code-Conductor)
- [ ] Set up parallel development environment
- [ ] Create test project with isolated components
- [ ] Establish baseline measurement methodology

### **Phase 1B: Parallel Development Test (Week 1-2)**
- [ ] Design 3-4 independent stories with minimal cross-dependencies
- [ ] Launch parallel agents in separate git worktrees
- [ ] Track development time and quality metrics
- [ ] Document challenges and solutions

### **Phase 1C: Results Analysis (Week 2)**
- [ ] Compare sequential vs parallel development times
- [ ] Analyze code quality and integration complexity
- [ ] Document lessons learned and optimization opportunities
- [ ] Validate 76% time reduction claim

## 🏗️ **Test Project Architecture**

### **SISO Agent Dashboard (Test Case)**
```
siso-agent-dashboard/
├── frontend/           # React interface components
├── agent-core/         # Core agent logic
├── api-wrapper/        # Backend API integration
└── voice-interface/    # Speech recognition (optional)
```

### **Story Breakdown for Parallel Development**
1. **Frontend Interface** → Agent 1 (React specialist)
2. **Agent Core Logic** → Agent 2 (AI architect) 
3. **API Wrapper** → Agent 3 (Integration specialist)
4. **Voice Interface** → Agent 4 (Audio specialist)

**Expected Timeline:**
- Sequential: ~12 hours
- Parallel: ~3-4 hours (75% reduction target)

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### **Primary Metrics**
- [ ] Development time reduction: Target 76%
- [ ] Agent coordination: 3-4 agents simultaneously
- [ ] Code quality: No degradation vs sequential development
- [ ] Integration complexity: <5% merge conflicts

### **Secondary Metrics**
- [ ] Context preservation across agents
- [ ] Specialized expertise utilization
- [ ] Error rate and debugging efficiency
- [ ] Developer satisfaction and workflow quality

## 🛠️ **Implementation Tools**

### **Option A: Conductor UI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Download from conductor.build (Mac only)
# Features: Visual dashboard, automatic git worktrees, progress monitoring
```

### **Option B: Code-Conductor (Cross-platform)**
```bash
# Open source alternative
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanmac/code-conductor/main/conductor-init.sh | bash
```

### **Option C: Manual SANDBOX**
```bash
# Full control approach using git worktrees
git worktree add ../siso-frontend feature/frontend-interface
git worktree add ../siso-agent-core feature/agent-logic
git worktree add ../siso-api feature/api-wrapper
git worktree add ../siso-voice feature/voice-interface
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Tool Selection**: Choose SANDBOX implementation method
2. **Environment Setup**: Create isolated development workspaces
3. **Story Design**: Define clear boundaries for parallel development
4. **Agent Launch**: Start parallel development with time tracking
5. **Results Analysis**: Document findings and optimization opportunities

**Status**: Ready for POC implementation  
**Confidence**: High - based on battle-tested research  
**Timeline**: 2 weeks for complete validation  
**Expected ROI**: 76% development time reduction validation

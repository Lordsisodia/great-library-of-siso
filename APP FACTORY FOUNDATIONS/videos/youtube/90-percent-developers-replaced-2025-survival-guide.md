## Full Transcript

(00:00) In the next year, half the development is going to be done by AI. Already the current models of AI, they can code better than 60 70% of coders and highly skilled jobs that pay really good salaries. A lot of that work is going to go away.

(00:23) We believe as an industry that in the next 1 year the vast majority of programmers will be replaced by AI programmers. What we are finding is we are not far from the world. But I think we'll be there in 3 to 6 months where AI is writing 90% of the code. Developers are absolutely cooked in 2025. In fact, if your only skill is coding, you're probably going to lose your job as soon as next year.

(00:47) I know how it sounds, but hear me out. As of now, in 2025 alone, over 22,000 of tech workers have already lost their jobs due to layoffs. Companies like Cisco, Google, Dell, Meta all laid off thousands of programmers while putting tens of millions of dollars into AI at the same time. The latest OpenAI models already rank among the top 50 programmers in the world.

(01:20) And the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Otman, predicts that we're going to have a number one AI programmer in the world as soon as this year. I think our internal benchmark is now around 50 and maybe we'll hit number one by the end of this year. So, literally an AI agent that can code better than any human. So, in this video, I'm going to give you a clear step-by-step survival guide for the next few years.

(01:44) I'll explain exactly how the role of developers is going to change or even completely disappear in 2025 and how you can not just adapt but lead in this new fully automated agentic AI world. But first, who am I to talk about this? Well, I manage a team of 25 developers myself and I've been coding AI apps for over 4 years now.

(02:17) My company builds AI agents for businesses, realworld AI agents that actually automate real tasks. So, not only I'm a developer myself, but I've personally deployed development AI agents, not just internally, but for multiple other companies as well. So, there's literally no one better to talk about this than me.

(02:42) And by the way, somewhere in the middle of this video, I will also even give you a demo of a real web development agent that we built for one of our clients. Now, let's dive in. To wrap our heads around what's happening right now, we must first put all this into a perspective because, as they say, history does not repeat itself, but it often rhymes. And what we're experiencing right now, humanity has actually already gone through multiple times in the past during what's known as industrial revolutions.

(03:14) Today, it's just happening at a much faster pace and a totally different scale. So, understanding how different skilled workers had to adapt in similar rapid technological changes in the past will give you a very unique perspective through which you can better understand how to navigate the current AI revolution.

(03:40) And the closest example of a highly skilled role that got almost fully automated during the 19th century is a weaver. Yes, the person who weaves fabric into textiles. Just like today developers weave code into software. So in 19th century weaving was a very highpaying job. In early 1800s skilled weavers could earn about two to three times higher wages than a typical farm worker in Britain.

(04:05) Besides, what's funny is that they could even work independently from home just like developers today. However, after the proliferation of the power loom, which is an automated mechanical weaving machine, all workers were called back into factories, which is exactly what by the way just happened at Google. And then in around 1830s, their wages dropped significantly back to the level of a farm worker.

(04:31) Yet at the same time, one weaver could now produce the output of 10 to 20 different weavers before combined. However, it didn't stop there because in the next 100 years, the weaving technology advanced so far that today the entire weaving process is fully automated.

(04:58) We have all kinds of fully automated power looms called rapier loom, air jet loom, water jet loom where a single operator can control hundreds of automatic looms alone. Companies like Zara today produce 450 million garments annually with just 11 factories. So machines no longer just assist people in a weaving industry. They've completely replaced them. Similarly, today everyone says that you won't be replaced by AI. You will be replaced by someone who uses AI.

(05:29) And that's true for now. But the transition to full automation might happen much faster than you think. Just take a look at this study, thousands of AI authors on the future of AI. In this paper, it has been shown that in the span of one year from 2022 to 2023, thousands of AI experts revised their predictions on the major AI milestones like AGI by 48 years.

(06:02) So, not only AI is advancing faster than anyone could have predicted before, but it's also accelerating as we go. So what took us 150 years to fully automate then might take us only one to two years today. In fact, the CEO of Google already claims that AI is responsible for generating over 25% of all their code.

(06:26) And the CEO of Microsoft says that it's somewhere between 20 to 30%. So I would say maybe 20 30% of the code that is inside of our repos today in some of our projects are probably all uh written by software. This is exactly why understanding history dynamics is so important. While many of you are probably already utilizing the latest AI coding tools, very few of you realize that it's going to go far beyond just simple tools.

(06:57) So to help you better visualize this transition, I've created what I call the labor automation curve. On the xaxis, we have the effort required to complete a given task. And the yaxis shows the output or the results produced. Notably, the more automated a job becomes, the more nonlinear results we start to get for our efforts.

(07:21) And this process can be further divided into three distinct stages. In the first manual stage, the process is still almost fully manual. So the results that you get almost exactly match the efforts that you invested into a given task. Then as we move into the next stage, which is assistance like during the industrial revolution with sewing machines, we start to see a noticeable increase in productivity.

(07:50) Now humans no longer perform all the manual work themselves. They still do a major portion of the work, but their efforts are now significantly amplified by the machines. A single person can now produce the same output as 10 or more people combined. And finally, when we reach the third agency stage, machines take full control over the implementation, meaning that humans no longer do any of the work themselves.

(08:19) Humans only design things and tell machines what to do. At this stage, productivity skyrockets as one human can achieve more than a thousand times the output of what they could achieve before with the same [Music] effort. So at what stage are we at right now and where are we heading next? Currently we are at the end of the second assistance stage.

(08:48) You've probably seen dozens of co-pilots and AI assisted idees where developers are wipe coding entire apps just by chatting with AI. Vip coding is only possible at the second stage. Today AI still hallucinates it lacks agency and long horizon task execution. This is why at this stage AI or any other technology still requires constant supervision and feedback from the user to operate reliably. These are the main challenges that we face in our EI agency today.

(09:19) To make our agents reliable, we need to constantly add guard rails. We need to add multiple agents that supervise each other or we need to create multiple structured workflows. However, as you might guess, soon all of these limitations are going to go away. AI will not only be more reliable than most humans at coding, but it will also have agency, meaning that it will be able to operate autonomously and it will be able to run for days.

(09:50) Just look at the latest models by OpenAI, which I covered in my previous video. The length of tasks that AI can execute autonomously is growing exponentially. So in the next stage we'll move from wipe coding into what I call a fully agentic coding. And this is actually something that I've noticed Sam Alman emphasizing multiple times on interviews recently.

(10:13) Software development has already been pretty transformed. Like it's quite amazing how different the process of creating software is now than it was 2 years ago. But I expect like another move that big in the coming months as Agentic software engineering really starts to happen.

(10:31) So what we're going to see in the next stage is swarms of AI agents performing all implementation work autonomously. Humans will no longer be coding themselves. They will only be reviewing the code and telling AI what to do. So while I do believe that the developer role is going to disappear soon, there will be new opportunities for people to train and maintain AI agents on their code bases.

(10:57) You see, when assigning a task to AI, you don't really want it to build just some random website. You want an AI agent to build a website that has your logo, that has your colors, your branding, and that's using the exact same text tag and architecture that your team is most familiar with.

(11:17) Just like a real employee, an AI agent needs to be onboarded onto your company. It needs to have all the internal documentation, processes and tools in order to perform its tasks because even the three agent needs a bunch of tools and what shape should they be uh what should their infrastructure, what should their sandboxes be. So a lot of what we're going to do uh is essentially evolve even what does the GitHub repo construct even look for the sui agent.

(11:43) So, it's not the people who know how to use AI. It's the people who know how to replace themselves with AI that will thrive in the future. So, I hope it all makes sense now. But before I dive into my detailed step-by-step survival guide, I first want to address some common counterarguments to what I just said.

(12:09) Recently, Antropic released a paper called on the biology of large language models, which gave us some insights into the internal reasoning of LLMs. According to this paper, it seems like the chain of thoughts that these models generate aren't real thinking processes. Instead, the models are just trying to mimic how a human would reason and tell us what we want to see.

(12:32) And the chief AI at Meta also already said that he's no longer even interested in LLMs anymore. Not so interested in LLMs anymore. I'm excited about things that a lot of people in this community in the tech community might get excited about 5 years from now. He also claims that historically we've also been consistently wrong about which technologies would lead us to AGI.

(12:55) So there's been sort of a a repeated history over the last 70 years in AI of people coming up with a new paradigm and then claiming okay that's it you know this is going to take us to human level AI within 10 years you know most intelligent entity on the planet would be a machine and you know every time it's turned out to be to be false because the new paradigm either hits a limitation that people didn't see or you know turned out to be really good at solving a subcategory of problem that not you does didn't turn out to be like the general intelligence problem. So there is a chance that LLMs might not

(13:29) actually be the thing that will take us to AGI. If that's the case, we might see another year or two of an AI winter where nothing happens until we find something that works. But I do believe that one way or the other, we will find something that works very soon.

(13:54) I don't know if it's going to be 1 year or if it will be 5 years, but even with today's AI technology, we can automate pretty much any business out there. It just takes us longer. So, it doesn't even matter if LLMs are going to be the thing that gets us to AGI because this industry is going to be completely transformed this year. Anyways, this is exactly why I decided to make this video for you.

(14:15) So, here is my complete step-by-step survival guide for [Music] 2025. Step one, stay ahead of the curve. First, you need to find and test the best AI tools and the AI models available for developers right now. I don't want to provide you with the exact list myself because the new stuff in AI is coming out almost every day.

(14:40) However, I do have some general categories of tools that you need to learn. First, you need to learn an AI coding IDE. Second, you need to learn how to use chat GPT or clot. Third, you need to learn the LLM APIs. Fourth, if you're working with frontends, you will also need an AI UI builder.

(15:02) And fifth, you will need to learn an AI agent framework. But again, to stay ahead of the curve, you need not just learn the current AI tools, but to actually test new tools and adopt them as they appear on the market. I personally have a separate Twitter account for all AI news. And I use an app called Read Vice Reader, which combines all newsletters into one feed and even summarizes them for me with AI.

(15:28) YouTube, however, in my opinion, is the best resource to learn anything in AI right now. There are so much alpha content that you can just search and find tutorials literally on any topic completely for free. It only takes me around 15 minutes a day to check all of the latest AI news.

(15:49) Once you've picked your AI tools, the next step is to master AI coding. You can't start from agentic coding if you don't understand AI coding first. In fact, those are extremely similar. The only difference between AI coding and Agentic coding is that in Agentic coding, instead of prompting an AI tool yourself, you build an agent that does it for you.

(16:14) This is why knowing how to write code with AI will actually make building AI agents much easier for you later. So, here are my best tips for AI coding. First, always plan your tasks. I see so many people today just jumping straight into AI tools and hoping that they can build an entire 20page SAS application for them from a single prompt. This is not how you code with AI.

(16:38) To generate full stack large scale apps like this, you first need to break them down into clear tasks just like a human developer would. And to do that, you can either chat with a reasoning model and create a special plan yourself or you can use another tool that works as an extension to your AI IDE and plans your apps for you. The most popular such extensions right now are task master and cursor memory bank.

(17:03) They automatically break down your apps into manageable tasks and then send each task one by one to AI coding idees. This way, your AI tools can run for much longer autonomously, and the results that they produce are also significantly better. The next essential tip is to always test first.

(17:25) Coding is one of the very few tasks that can actually be fully verified, meaning we can always check whether the code works correctly or not. This is why we've seen so much progress in coding with AI. So make sure you always instruct your AI coding tools to write tests first. This way they can validate their own code and significantly reduce hallucinations.

(17:50) Also they will be able to run for much longer. Use MCP servers. Explore various marketplaces to find the MCPS that you need. If you don't know what MCPS are, watch my previous video that explains exactly that. I'll leave a link down below. My personal favorite MCP right now is MEM0. It allows you to save your coding preferences and essentially gives your IDE a memory feature similar to chat GPT.

(18:16) This means that cursor or Windinsurf will actually remember all your coding preferences, your previous projects and every time you swear on it for not fixing that bug. And the final tip is to use AI models strategically. Although right now the best coding models are 03 and 04 mini, it doesn't mean that you should be using them all the time. Use implementationbased models like GPT4.

(18:41) 1 when you know exactly what needs to be done and how. These non-reasoning models today are extremely fast, cheap, and reliable when the task is clear. And the reasoning models perform best when you're unsure about how to complete it. Overall, AI coding today is an essential skill and it's expected to know this in 2025 for any developer. But if you really want to prepare yourself for the future, you need to think ahead.

(19:05) Which brings us to the next step. Build your first AI agents. Building AI agents is the single most important skill you can develop right now. If you don't want to be replaced by AI, you need to learn how to replace yourself with an AI agent. And the good news is that it's not as complicated as you might think.

(19:28) Building AI agent just comes down to four simple steps. Build, deploy, evaluate, and iterate. First, you need to build an MVP as quickly as possible. Don't overthink it. Just get something working. And then once it's working, deploy it into production. Allow it to run in a real production environment where it will be used and get some real feedback.

(19:49) Then evaluate the results and finally iterate by going to step one and building the next version based on the real data and the feedback that you collected. This is exactly how we build AI agents for our clients today and it's the only way you can perfect them for a given task. Without real world data, your agents will never self-improve.

(20:12) I have a ton of videos on this channel that walk you through exactly how build EI agents step by step. So, I'll also leave the links down below. Step four, once you've built your first EI agents, the next step is to move into a more senior role.

(20:31) It's funny that the jobs that our parents told us would be safe, like lawyers or programmers, are getting replaced first. And the jobs that our parents told us to avoid, like sports or artists, are here to stay. But in any case, if your industry is getting disrupted by EI, it's always the lower level positions that will be automated first. So move into a more senior role as soon as possible.

(20:56) Become an architect, product lead, or a UX designer instead of just a developer. Design and architecture work requires deep context and understanding that AI can't easily replace. You need to understand the entire project's history, market conditions, competition, future vision, and combine it all with your previous experiences, which simply cannot be expressed in words and pass down to AI.

(21:24) Many times you make decisions subconsciously and you can't even articulate them because we process a lot more information subconsciously. Additionally, when AI can build literally anything just from a single prompt, the how becomes more crucial than the what. Often the best products succeed not because of the underlying code, but because of their positioning, timing, and user experience. So, be the person who makes those strategic decisions rather than just writes code.

(21:51) Those people that make decisions will be the ones who will be deploying and maintaining AI agents for these tasks. This will definitely keep you safe for the next few years. But if you want to be completely safe for life, you need to start your own thing. Which brings us to step five. Start a side hustle or a startup.

(22:13) My friend David Andre always says, "The only people who are not afraid of AI taking their jobs are the entrepreneurs." Just think about it. Who benefits from you becoming 10 or 20 times more productive? I'm going to open you a secret. It's not you, it's the person you work for. So developers don't necessarily get the financial rewards or the recognition for becoming 10 or 20 times more efficient.

(22:38) Especially if everyone around them becomes more efficient as well. It just becomes the new baseline. It's the people who own the businesses that benefit from your productivity gains because it directly impacts their bottom line. So if you really want to build wealth in 21st century, you need to switch from accumulating salaries to accumulating assets.

(22:59) You need to stop working for someone and start working for yourself. Start building something on a site where your productivity gains from using AI go directly into your pocket. The best part is that today you can literally start a business without any employees at all.

(23:19) What used to take five or 10 people to create before now can easily be done with just one person who knows how to use AI really well. So let me actually show you what this looks like in practice. Hi, I'm at I'm a senior software developer in version AI. I will be taking you through the demo of a website builder agency we've built for one of our clients which is capable of generating entire NexJS apps on its own.

(23:39) All right, now let's get into the demo. First things first, to add an extra personal touch to my website, I'll provide my own logo first. But since I'm no graphic designer, let's quickly make it together by using available AI tools. For image generation, I personally prefer using FAI services due to wide model selection and the ease of use.

(23:56) Let's add a descriptive prompt to generate the logo for the website. Okay, this one looks good. Now, let's just remove the background so it looks better on the website. For that, I'm just going to copy the image address. Selected model on themef.ai. AI. This time is the Bria background removed model. And here we have our image with the transparent background. Now that we have our logo ready, let's create the website.

(24:21) First things first, we need to describe to our manager agent what kind of website we want to make. In my case, I want to make an online store website that would sell keyboards to professional software developers. The primary goal of the website is obviously sales. Key features blog about selecting proper keyboard to attract more viewers and a product page to generate revenue. The website name will be key coder.

(24:39) The domain is free by the way. Whoever grabs it after this video, you're welcome. And I will also provide the logo image. All right. As you can see, the first step that it does is trends analysis to find the most appropriate styling, color scheme, and content structure for our website.

(24:57) So here agent provides a summary of trends analysis as well as the proposed website plan. I think it looks good. So we can proceed. Now the product agent will use Google Shopping API to find available products on the market and create a list of affiliate links to these products that will be used later during the website creation.

(25:16) Once it's done, manager agent reaches out to our developer agent to start the development process. Firstly, it'll create text contest for pages using page content creator tool. After that, it'll start developing next.js app and we'll use previously generated text using page content creator tool.

(25:35) So developer agent will sequentially use these tools to create a entire website page by page. Of course we can't expect the system to get everything right. So we need to make sure the pages look correct and compile without errors. That's why we have QA validator agent that essentially builds the nextJS app locally along with running some other checks and returns error if there are any. All right. So now that our website compiles successfully, we can approve its deployment.

(25:58) Next, our developer agent will push locally stored directory with the next.js application to our GitHub which will automatically trigger a pipeline to deploy this app on Versal. After which the QA agent will check this website once again. This time it will check a deployed version though and provide it performance metrics. Now let's see this website for ourselves.

(26:20) As you can see the generated website has a clean design, highly responsive as all the pages we asked for and even added some extra pages like about us and a contact page. All the products listed here are linked with affiliate links that lead to sellers websites directly. Of course, we do have our blog over here that has a nicely formatted table of contents.

(26:39) And of course, we have a dark mode because come on, it's win25 outside. We do due respect our customers. Well, that's about it for this agency. You could argue that you can achieve the same results just by vi coding the website and you will be right. However, the biggest difference between building agents and VIP coding is that with this approach, not only get results faster, but the entire process is nearly hands-free for the user.

(26:57) It only requires initial input and deployment approval and does not rely on users programming skills to maintain correct project structure, handle deployment, testing, bug fixing, and all that annoying stuff you have to deal with when wipe coding. It's actually quite impressive how with the right tools, OpenAI agents are already capable of building entire websites from the ground up on their own within minutes.

(27:15) Well, let's get back to RS and see if he's got anything that would scare backenders as well. You can easily get started by finding clients on freelance marketplaces like Fiverr or Upwork, which is exactly how I got started. But then to scale your business even further and become fully independent, you need to build a personal brand, which brings us to the step number six, share your experience.

(27:39) Content creation and distribution are going to be the most valuable skills in this new AIdriven age. As implementation becomes fully automated, distribution will become more important than the product itself. Knowing how to build a good product isn't enough anymore. The market is already oversaturated with all sorts of AI apps, and even people without any coding experience are now vibe coding SAS products that generate 10 to 50K a month in revenue. Plus, when deep fakes are becoming so scary good, genuine human connection and authenticity will

(28:12) become even more important. These things will never get replaced. Even though AI has long surpassed humans in both chess and go, people still watch humans play those games. So, learn how to create authentic content and build genuine communities. This is what I'm personally doing right now.

(28:31) We're building a community first and then we are creating a product for that community, not the reverse. So if you want to join our community which is completely free and contains all the resources that you need to get started with building AI agents, I'll leave a link below.

(28:48) The only requirement for us to join is to sign up for our product which is also completely free to get started. Now there's one more question that people are asking me all the time. Do I still need to learn how to code? And my honest answer is yes. You still need to learn how to code, but do it for yourself, not for money. Here are my three reasons why.

(29:09) First, knowing how to code is still incredibly valuable. Not because you'll be writing any code yourself soon, but because it gives you a completely new way of thinking about how the underlying technology works. At the core, AI is also just code. So by knowing how to code, you will be able to communicate with AI much better.

(29:30) You'll be able to better understand how it works under the hood and how you can use it more effectively. Secondly, nearly all AI agents today must interact with code in some way, whether curing databases, processing data or communicating with APIs. So when you learn how to code, building AI agents also becomes much easier. And third, it will help you to develop crucial problem solving skills.

(29:54) These will also be invaluable because it's the people who find the most unique ways to apply AI today that will make the largest impact. So, let me know in the comments where you are working right now and how are you planning to adapt for the future. All the links that I mentioned will be in the description. Thanks for watching. Five.

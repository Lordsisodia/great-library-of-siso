## Guest Background - Jason (jxnlco)
- **Top AI consultant** working with major companies like **Zapier and HubSpot**
- **Instructor library** - 2.6 million downloads per month
- **Changed how we think about AI agents** - used by largest organizations
- **7-figure consulting business** - over six figures per month
- **10+ years in machine learning** before AI boom

## Core Philosophy: AI Agents as Portfolio of Tools

### Definition of AI Agents
- **"LLM with a portfolio of tools"** - not complex systems
- **"Tool caller in a for loop"** - simple conceptual model
- **Future evolution:** O3 model shows 1.7 hours autonomous task execution
- **For loop may become unnecessary** as models improve

### Portfolio Approach Benefits
- **Add/remove tools dynamically** based on data analysis
- **Add different context** to change agent behavior
- **Combine tools for economically valuable agents**
- **Focus on tool verification** - what can and cannot do

## Making Agents Reliable in Production

### Topic Analysis & Clustering Technique
**Core Strategy:**
1. **Set up evals from the start** - track every metric possible
2. **Group conversations into clusters** (finances, scheduling, tables)
3. **Compute same score for each group**
4. **Identify low-performing clusters** for targeted improvement
5. **Add missing context or tools** to problematic areas

### Data-Driven Improvement Process
- **"Grouping things together so you know how to cut them up"**
- **Example:** "Marketing bad" → "Marketing works well for under 25, bad for over 25"
- **Actionable insights** lead to clear decisions
- **Forever loop:** Analyze → Fix → Measure → Repeat

## Common Pitfalls in Agent Deployment

### The "Smart AI" Fallback
- **"More I think a company thinks they need smarter AI, the dumber the team is"**
- **Wrong approach:** Let AI figure everything out
- **Right approach:** Talk to customers, watch experts, model specific pipelines

### Overengineering Problem
- **Agents can't do anything and everything**
- **Focus on specific, well-defined tasks**
- **Model expert workflows** rather than general intelligence

## Tech Stack & Framework Recommendations

### Technology Selection
- **"Let the company pick the stack"** - work with existing tools
- **Common stacks:** LangChain, Pydantic
- **Speed over perfection:** "Build something quickly, start tracking data"
- **MVP approach:** Rather spend 6 months building than 6 months analyzing

### Real-World Challenges
- **Multilingual problems** (Turkey/China users)
- **Unexpected user behavior** patterns
- **Infrastructure scaling** issues
- **UI/UX adaptation** for different markets

## Agent Productization Strategy

### Vertical Integration Focus
- **"Build something for everyone is still very hard"**
- **Work with vertically integrated companies**
- **Interview experts** in specific domains
- **Replace difficult parts** of existing jobs
- **Avoid competing with OpenAI** on general chatbots

### Distribution & Product Balance
- **"Only two problems: distribution and product"**
- **AI makes product easier** → Focus more on distribution
- **Learn marketing and self-promotion**
- **Value-based pricing** over hourly rates

## Future of Software Development

### Developer Role Evolution
1. **Distribution matters more than ever**
2. **Code organization** for AI compatibility
3. **High-quality documentation** in sync with code
4. **Agent-friendly code structure** (multiple vs single files)

### AI-First Development Practices
- **6,000 lines of docs** generated by Cursor/Claude
- **Documents mention code files** for agent navigation
- **Cloud files scattered** in repository explaining processes
- **Cursor rules** for code review automation
- **Multi-PR strategy** - break large changes into reviewable chunks

### Development Workflow Revolution
- **PR automation:** Create multiple small PRs instead of mega-PRs
- **Context integration:** Pull GitHub comments back into development context
- **Mobile review:** Comment on phone, fix on desktop
- **Infinite scalability:** Agents can create thousands of parallel PRs

## Pricing Strategy & Value-Based Models

### Pricing Philosophy Shift
- **From hourly to value-based pricing**
- **"Would I pay $2,000 for marketing AI?"**
- **"Should I pay when meeting booked or sale made?"**
- **Alignment through success-based pricing**

### Consulting Pricing Structure
- **Minimum engagement:** $60,000-$80,000 over 2-3 months
- **Customer filtering:** Serious seed companies vs enterprises
- **Problem-focused pricing:** Based on business pain size
- **Guarantee structure:** Performance-based payment models

### Value Recognition Story
- **$700/hour interview work** → Made $20,000
- **Recruiter made $200,000** (20% of payroll for 4 engineers)
- **Head of AI equity gains** from $20M Series B
- **Lesson:** "Most exploited person in engagement despite high hourly rate"

## RAG Applications - Systematic Improvement

### Course: "Systematically Improving RAG Applications"
**Step-by-step playbook from consulting experience:**

#### Phase 1: Search System Evaluation
1. **Create precision and recall evaluations** for search system
2. **Collect user feedback data** (thumbs up/down, complaints)
3. **Fine-tune embedding models** (not language models)
4. **$3-4 training cost** for 10-15% performance improvement

#### Phase 2: Tool Discovery & Implementation
1. **Topic modeling** to identify missing tools
2. **Solve individual topics** with specific tools
3. **Tool usage verification** - ensure correct usage
4. **Example:** GitHub tools vs command line access impact

### Fine-Tuning Strategy
- **Language model fine-tuning:** Generally not worth it (inference costs)
- **Embedding/reranker fine-tuning:** Very worth it ($3-4 for 10-15% improvement)
- **RAG fine-tuning more valuable** than LLM fine-tuning

## Agent Development Methodology

### Dynamic Tool Addition
1. **Deploy agent with minimal tools** first
2. **Test in real world** conditions
3. **Analyze usage data** for missing functionality
4. **Add tools based on 10-30% customer requests**
5. **Data-driven decision making** over assumptions

### Business Process Modeling
- **Start like a business:** Do tasks manually first
- **Discover subprocesses** through repetition
- **Standard Operating Procedures** emerge from experience
- **CEO/employee responsibility** to identify automation opportunities

## Getting Started as AI Consultant

### First Client Acquisition
1. **Build tools for problems you understand** personally
2. **Write about pain points** you've experienced
3. **Free content strategy** for community building
4. **Referral network** from existing expertise

### Mindset Shifts for Success
- **Write from customer pain perspective** not learning achievements
- **Focus on business benefits** not personal intelligence
- **"How you can improve your business"** vs "What I learned this week"
- **Value creation** over skill demonstration

### Content Strategy
- **Problems other companies face** today
- **Mistakes to avoid** rather than personal wins
- **Customer pain and solution benefits**
- **Avoid limiting earning potential** with hourly mindset

## Future Roadmap & Tools

### Instructor Library Evolution

1. **Cura (KURA)** - Topic analysis library (already released)
2. **Light version of Ragus** - Eval library (in development)
3. **AI Engineering Summit presentation** upcoming
4. **Conversation analysis tools** for AI improvement

### Data Analysis Revolution
- **"Conversations with AI now most interesting dataset"**
- **Group data, find metrics, explore patterns**
- **ChatGPT knows more than parents** - massive data opportunity

## Business Model & Market Position

### Market Opportunities
- **Independent developers:** $1-2M per person businesses possible
- **40% of business is code** - 60% is entrepreneurial
- **Niche vertical solutions** big tech can't cover
- **Specific expertise requirements** create defensible moats

### Competitive Positioning

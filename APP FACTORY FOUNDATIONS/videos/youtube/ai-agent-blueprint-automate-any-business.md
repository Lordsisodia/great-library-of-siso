(00:00) so in today's video I will present you with our entire blueprint for automating any business with AI agents completely from scratch I will explain the seven key steps in our process that we use to go from finding your first client to building out as many agents for them as possible until your or your client's business literally runs by itself before we get started my name is areni and we were the first AI agencies to start building real production AI agents not examples back in 2024 today we already have over 20 people and we are still

(00:43) continuing to scale and Pioneer this new agents as a service model on this channel I'm sharing with you all of our learnings completely for free now let's Dive Right In the first step in our blueprint is of course to find a client a frequent mistake that I see people make in the space is waiting too long to find their first client many people think that they need to master AI agent development completely before starting to offer real services but the truth is you can get your first client even before you build any agents at all yes

(01:25) that's true you can actually learn everything you need to know along the way up after you got your first client and in my opinion it's a much better way to do this not only you will get paid for it which is a pretty significant Advantage but you will also learn faster because you'll be learning from real experience and feedback but the best part is that you already probably know someone who could massively benefit from AI agents because those people are typically business owners and entrepreneurs and everyone knows at

(02:01) least a couple of them maybe it's your death friend who owns a small restaurant or maybe it's someone who you studied with at college or maybe even it's a company that you work for right now so just reach out to them and tell them that you're starting to build AI agents that can improve efficiency and automate their boring repetitive tasks this is called warm Outreach by the way and that's usually the first way that I would recommend to find your client the second way that I would recommend for beginners is using freelance platforms

(02:39) like Fiverr or upwork right now there's practically zero competition for AI agent Services most people still offer very basic outdated services that today can be completely replaced by eii agents so think about what industries you have the most experience with think about what you're passionate about and then search for similar services on these platforms even if you're not planning to offer your services through freelance platforms this exercise is still going to be incredibly valuable for you so try searching for example for marketing and

(03:18) instantly you can see that people are offering marketing strategies for over $600 so why would anyone buy a $600 marketing strategy if they can buy an agent that can generate infinite marketing strategies for them so the best part about these two methods is that they require no upfront investment literally it doesn't take you anything to outreach to some of the people you know and create those gigs on Fiverr and upwork and later you can then expand into other lead gen strategies like cold Outreach or organic content but

(03:53) definitely make sure you find your first client first because this will allow you to learn and get real feedback much faster and after you found your first client the next step is to find a problem so here's how we find problems to automate with AI agents in any business first you are looking for a recurring problem that your clients have struggled to automate before it needs to be a dynamic process that is performed repeatedly by one or more employees within the company it shouldn't be a simple process where each step and the

(04:33) sequence of those steps are determined in advance because such processes can be easily automated with tools like zapier or make we are looking specifically for more Dynamic processes that are never executed twice in the exact same way so typically in such processes there's always something that can go wrong so the agent needs to adapt based on circumstances take for example project management managing multiple employees at different time zones managing delays dealing with changes in requirements all of these things simply cannot be mapped

(05:12) out on a workflow Builder it would be impossible or another great example is content creation where you need to constantly provide your agent with regular feedback just like you would provide it to a human blog writer and the easiest way to uncover these processes within a business is to start from Sops or standard operating procedures luckily most businesses have already documented these processes somewhere so typically all you need to do is just ask however if your client doesn't have these processes documented

(05:51) which of course does happen quite frequently you'll need to get curious and uncover these processes by yourself so here are some great practical questions that we use in our agency to find these processes all the time what roles currently exist in your company which processes are currently causing the most frustration for you which departments have recently been struggling to scale which tasks do your employees find themselves doing repeatedly on a weekly or daily basis if you want to get our full AI strategy

(06:32) meeting template completely for free then head over to our school Community which previously was available only to our paid subscribers of our platform there's also some additional extra content and playbooks there that you can use to get started completely for free the reason we are making this community public is because we are now adding a free plan to our platform which hopefully should be available by the time you watch this video so make sure to sign up and if it's not available we'll notify you okay so after asking

(07:05) these questions you should have a few very concrete ideas of what you can automate however before you start building please consider carefully which agent to deploy first focusing on a wrong agent at the beginning caused a ton of frustration for us and for our clients when we were just getting started your first agent is the most important if it takes too long for you to build your first agent or if it doesn't bring enough value then most likely the client is simply not going to continue with the second one so you will

(07:42) never have a chance to fully automate their business so now we use this formula to calculate the ROI for any given process so we'll leave the formula here on the screen I've previously covered it in another video and a key thing to note is that hours are total hours performed by all employees currently responsible for this process and operational costs are just model costs which typically are pretty much negligible so essentially what this formula shows you is that you are looking for processes that are either

(08:14) performed by many employees at the same time or that are performed by very expensive positions and at the same time are relatively simple to build so it sounds really obvious but make sure you actually consider all of these parameters to together because it is really tempting to just jump into the first agent solution that comes to mind and this is has actually been holding us back for quite a while in our agency until we really started to resist building the agents that client tells us to build and instead focus on what they

(08:49) really need we were actually stale for a very long time so to gauge the complexity of your agent A good rule of thumb is that the more apis your agent has to connect conect to or the harder it is to work with those apis the harder the agent will be for you to build so make sure that you again consider all of these together and then after you pick the best process to automate you are ready for the next step which is building an MVP so when you're building an MVP there are basically two paths that you can take you can either use a

(09:24) framework or you can use a platform and the main difference is that with a framework you have more flexib ability and control but there's more technical experience required and with a platform typically there might be some extra cost involved however it's much easier to use so my recommendation is actually go with a platform whenever possible and if that's not possible only then use a framework yes you see when we just got started building agents in our agency we used to only use a framework but then we realized that it would take us sometimes

(10:00) 2 days to build an agent but then it would also take us 3 days to deploy it and deployment is like tedious backand engineering tasks that no one enjoys so that's exactly why we built our own platform that combines the flexibility of a framework with the Simplicity of a platform and soon we'll also be adding a very cool feature on our platform where you'll be able to deploy agents built with a framework directly on our platform with with just a few clicks from GitHub however regardless which approach you select you need to know

(10:35) that all agents consist of three primary components which are instructions knowledge and actions and most of the time you will actually spend on actions which are the tools tools are the most important component in any eii agent system because that's how your agents deliver value unlike standard llms agents shouldn't just provide resp responses to your users they should actually execute the tasks this is the key thing about agents they actually deliver value by executing tasks this is why we start from the tools we first

(11:11) connect our agents to all of the same systems that employees use throughout the process and only then we work on prompting and knowledge so for example if your client uses Trello for project management you need to ensure that the agent can interact with the Trello API as well and if the use Google Drive or GitHub in the process then you need to connect the agent to these systems as well so we recently updated the documentation for a framework I personally spent over 30 hours on it and it contains detailed instructions on how

(11:44) you can create Reliable Tools with penic penic is the only right way for you to create agents because it allows you to validate all of the agent inputs and outputs in the tools this is key because it helps you to reduce any hallucinations by by the way people have been asking me about penic Ai and honestly I was really disappointed by this framework because they are using penic in all their own places they're using it for structured outputs but they're actually not using it for the tools which is where things can actually

(12:15) go wrong like if the agent executes one action incorrectly then it might cause some issues like it could erase all of your files from a Google drive right so this is why we only build tools with pen lastly just one more quick tip by the way this is also an example from our community where I'm currently also hosting weekly Q&A calls which you can join and someone asked me on one of these calls what should they do if the client doesn't have all of the necessary data stored somewhere for the agent to access and the solution was quite simple

(12:48) you simply prom the agent to ask for this information directly so this helps you to avoid the problem of the agent not having access to some systems and after your agent is set up the next step is to integrate it so Integrations are just as important as your agent capabilities because how easy it is for your client to use your agent can often determine its success so here are six primary Integrations to consider for your agents number one web interface this is a standalone chat app like chat jpt it's great for both internal and

(13:28) external agents when other options are not available number two widgets widgets are embeddable chats that you can often see at the bottom of websites these are ideal for external customer facing scenarios like customer support number three Messengers Messengers are communication platforms that your client already uses like slack or Whatsapp at our agency we found that slack is particularly important because almost all of our clients use Slack to communicate with their own employees that's why it's already supported on our

(14:04) platform and you can even create one slack agent completely for free number four third party software what's less frequently used however but is still a huge opportunity is integrating agents into other common software tools like Salesforce GitHub notion and others sometimes you actually don't even need to run an agent in a chat like interface because you can trigger it based on certain events so for example we had a case study where we integrated an agent into an Azure devops environment so instead of triggering it with a message

(14:41) it was triggered any time there was a new task posted on a Azure devops board just like a human developer would so instead of just reading messages in chat this agent was reading comments and requirements posted on this task by other developers and anytime we would change the status of this this task it would review them again and then proceed to the next stage number five Chrome jobs Chrome jobs allow you to execute your agents on a fixed schedule like hourly daily weekly and so on so for example many businesses often generate

(15:15) reports every month and in this case you can simply schedule your report generator agent to run monthly as well we will soon be adding this feature on our platform too and lastly API API Integrations provide you with with full Flex ability to integrate your agents anywhere else so you can connect them to your own custom backends or any other internal software tools a key thing that you need to remember on this step is that your agent must be working in the exact same systems that your employees use daily if your client uses slack to

(15:49) chat with their data analyst agent then integrate this agent in slack as well this will make unboarding much simpler after you integrate your agent the next step is to iterate on it you see right now all agent development is an iterative process you will never get your agents right from the first attempt trust me so you need to be able to adjust them as you go back when I released our agency framework over a year ago I was personally managing and sometimes even developing most of our projects initially we started to charge

(16:26) per project just like with standard AI apps we used to build and although it worked well at the start the problem with agentic projects is that they are much more agile agentic projects are hands down the most agile projects that I've ever seen so what happened is that any time we would start working on an agent would immediately uncover more opportunities we didn't realize were there or a better approach that we initially have not foreen before primarily because now we had access to our clients and journal systems so we

(16:59) could see the business in and out so when working with your clients you need to ensure that you can adjust your agents as you go this is why we now entirely shifted to a new subscription based model which we still use to this day this subscription approach lets us to work as true partners with our clients because honestly when you're building AI agents you're not just like a software development shop you're more like a business growth agency so your goal isn't just to deliver agents it's to help business ACC to scale so of

(17:30) course it's completely fine to start from one of projects because it's easier to pit at the beginning but then once you get some momentum definitely make sure to switch to a more flexible model and once you've gathered some feedback and adjusted your agent and now that it's working well in your client's business the next way is to repeat you see today all businesses have way more potential agent Integrations that they can even imagine literally any role today can be replaced with an AI agent it's just a matter of time and effort

(18:04) but if you try to automate too many things at once you will never succeed so for this I recommend using divide and conquer approach first start with automating Sops then proceed to automating roles and then the Departments the key thing is that you must be automating the same roles and departments first so don't switch between different roles and departments too much because the more a agents you build for a single role or a department the more powerful they will become unlike automations or workflows agents

(18:36) can collaborate together so after for example we've built a few agents in the same Department what we typically do is combine those agents like with a manager agent and instantly the power of the system 10xs now the manager agent can use the analysis provided by the analyst agent and then coordinate with a marketing agent or a Content agent who can then take these insights and create a much better ad campaign or social media post for example so after you've successfully deployed your first agent don't stop there go back to step two

(19:10) which is find a problem and immediately look for additional Sops to solve within the same role or Department this is how you should proceed to automate and then simply keep repeating this process for as long as you can try to stay with the same client for as long as possible until again liter their business runs by itself and after you've built several agents preferably across even multiple clients the last step is to productize and scale by this point you will notice some patterns and similarities across some previous agents that you've built

(19:46) this is exactly where you have the opportunity to transform them into a more scalable specialized vertical solution so for example in our agency we built many Facebook marketing agents in a fast for various companies so now we are building a vertical Facebook marketing agent that can be reused quickly and customized for any business this previous experience allowed us to see which components from the three primary agent components I mentioned before remain constant and which need customization but the best part is that

(20:20) by productizing an agent you can then Implement a more scalable outcome based pricing similar to how traditional marketing agencies operate for example you can charge per lead per client or per appointment booked another Advantage is that you are no longer starting from scratch because you can improve the base agent and instantly all of the clients benefit from these improvements as well however don't try to create vertical agents without first building a few horizontal custom agents first otherwise you'll just be shooting in the dark

(20:54) without clearly understanding how this agent should perform the process across multiple businesses you risk building things that no one is going to need so soon we'll be releasing a more practical tutorial video on creating vertical agents complete with a free vertical agent template and in the meantime if you want to see how we build incredibly powerful custom horizontal e agents that even have memory and can self-improve completely from scratch I recommend watching this video next thank you and don't forget to subscribe
